## Mystery Novel

I became a big fan of mystery novels when I was in high school. They attracted me with seemingly impossible mysteries and surprising answers to those mysteries. Moreover, the strict logic behind the answers and the incredible feeling when I solved a mystery motivated me to pursue my PhD. My top-3 favorite mystery novel writers are Ellery Queen, Shinzou Mitsuda (三津田信三), and Yutaka Maya (麻耶雄嵩).

In 2017, I attended an activity discussing Agatha Christie's mystery novels in Chengdu. The activity was hosted by a Chinese mystery novel writer, Yehua Lu (陆烨华). The three images above show the presentation title given by Yehua Lu and his appreciation for the classic mystery novels.

<br>There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give [a fantastic speech], which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite lecturer** at the [best universities in my hometown].

## Movie

If mystery novels provide me with a sense of rational thinking, then movies offer me an emotional experience. I appreciate not only the stories in moives (screenplay) but also how moives tell a story (edit and cinematography). I used to go to theater more than 40 times in one year. I also enjoy predicting the Oscar winners every year. You can find more information on my [blogs](https://tiejin98.github.io/blogs/).


## Other Hobbies

I derive enjoyment from all forms of story-based entertainment, ranging from video games and animations to TV series. However, I've noticed that these activities require more time. Therefore, I seldom engage in these activities right now. Some of my favorite games and animations are Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.
